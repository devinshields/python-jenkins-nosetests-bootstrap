# python-jenkins-nosetests-bootstrap
teaching myself to set up and configure Jenkins for testing python projects, then automating that process


Purpose
-------

* have you ever had to work with folks who commit code without seeing if it compiles it first?
* has someone ever changed a major code API in code you are responsible for without consulting you?
* do you ever anticipate yourself coding in a blaze of glory one night when intoxicated forgetting to add a semi-colon before commiting?
  * or when having a brilliant idea just before bed?

Life is too short to watch unit tests run. S let's make easy some really useful CICD tooling really slick and easy to use.


Target
------

I want CICD for my projecs, but it can't suck or I won't use it. Requirements:

* super fast to configure and deploy
* simple to understand and maintain
* works on OSX & RHEL
* totally open source, portable, and available to me in secure environments
* strong preference for restricting dependence to strong and active OSS projects





## everything below: researches in action





getting started
---------------

Let's find some tutorials and RTFMs to see what's available in python's
open CIDI world:

* the [awesome alex conrad on python testing in Jenkins](http://www.alexconrad.org/2011/10/jenkins-and-python.html?m=1) - thank you sir!
* [some dude at a 2015 Jenkins conference](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/presentations/JUC-2015-Europe-Orchestrating-Your-Bhattacharya.pdf) - neat
* a [Jenkins python directory page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Python+Projects) - partially matches my own reasearch, a good sign
  * this one needs a second look, good links
* [buildbot looks interesting](http://docs.buildbot.net/current/tutorial/firstrun.html)...


install jenkins & install python's plugins
---------------------------------------------

```
$ brew install jenkins
$ open http://localhost:8080/
```

* install the `git` and `python` plugins for Jenkins by running:

```
$ ./jenkins_api_install_git_and_python_plugins.py
```

create a Jenkins job and start testing
---------------------------------------

* here's a [super simple project designed for testing demos](https://github.com/devinshields/testable_python_project)

* how to create the config_xml string:
  * turns out job_info() doubles as job_backup() if you store the resulting `.xml`
  * export [details here](https://www.sghill.net/how-do-i-backup-jenkins-jobs.html)


refocus on testing - what it possible with automate? (w/screen shots)
---------------------------------------------------------------

* [setup tutorial for humans](http://www.alexconrad.org/2011/10/jenkins-and-python.html?m=1)



research complete - now redo it al via the API
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm aiming for: a simple git repo of python and one job_config.xml file should do it:

* create python script that queryies for all Jobs
  * forearch, extract and store a Job pickle, or `job_config.xml` file
* delete the existing Jenkins server
  * purge everything - configs, plugins, everything
* create a vanilla Jenkins server from scratch (w/homebrew?)
* install all plugins
* restore all Jenkins Jobs
* trigger one build for each job


Jenkin Jobs and Source Control - Backup and Restore
---------------------------------------------------

a functional work in progress (files in the repo root):

* job_config_backup_via_curl.py
* job_config_restore_via_curl.py


Next Steps
----------

* gather up the minimum-set of artifacts a user would need to reconstruct a Jenkins Job
  * cache the formula in a new repo
